            <p>Mehndi is a form of body art and temporary skin decoration usually drawn on hands or legs, in which decorative designs are created on a person's body, using a paste, created from the powdered dry leaves of the henna plant (Lawsonia inermis). 
                It is a popular form of body art among the women of India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Iran, Maldives, and the Muslim population of Sri Lanka, and resembles similar practices found in North Africa and the Middle East.
                 This kind of body art is called Mehndi Design in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. 
                 Whereas, in West it is called Henna Designs.</p>
            <p>The Mehndi, a dye produced from a mehndi plant, would be delivered by the groom's relatives on a silver tray containing two burning candles.
                Before the application of the henna, the guests would throw coins over the bride's head as a symbol of fertility.
                 Then, the bride's soon to be mother-in-law would then bring out a piece of silk cloth as a gift to the bride. 
                 The bride would then walk along the unrolled piece of silk cloth in the direction of her future mother-in-law and kiss her hand.
                Once this is done, fruits, nuts, and pastries would be brought out and songs would be sung in hopes of making the bride cry.
                 This was done because it was thought that the bride's crying would bring good luck. The bride would then sit on a cushion while her mother-in-law placed a gold coin in her hand as another sign of good luck.
                  Once the bride was given the gold coin, the henna would be applied.
